Fresh Bitcoin Implementation

This is a new Bitcoin implementation built almost completely from the ground up.
It currently uses Pieter Wuille's secp256k1 implementation. Copyright (c) 2013 Pieter Wuille

With it I hope to try performance improvements and to also add security to Bitcoin through more diverse implementations.
